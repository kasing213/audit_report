Milestone: OpenAI-assisted audit translator wired in

- Added OpenAI translator (default model gpt-4o-mini via OPENAI_API_KEY/OPENAI_MODEL) with JSON normalization and fallback to rule-based parser when the API fails or is unset.
- Parser/bot flow is now async to store OpenAI results; raw_text is preserved even for AI outputs.
- Added prestart build hook so npm start auto-builds dist; npm run dev remains for ts-node.
- start-bot.sh loads .env, checks DATABASE_URL/TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/OPENAI_API_KEY, then runs dev mode.
- Reminder: disable BotFather privacy mode so the bot can read all group text messages (not just /commands).

How to run
- Development: npm run dev
- Production-ish: npm start (auto-builds first)
- Script: ./start-bot.sh (dev mode with env checks)

Optional next steps / ideas
- Add a minimal HTML report of recent audit logs and render to PDF using Puppeteer for daily summaries.
- Persist OpenAI response logs (redacted) in a separate collection for debugging/model quality tracking.
- Add health endpoint or telemetry to detect when Telegram/Mongo/OpenAI are unreachable.
